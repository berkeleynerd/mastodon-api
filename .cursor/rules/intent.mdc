We are creating a dart library intended to be used by a flutter mastodon client. 

We most always follow the following rules :

1. Always run the app using the development flavor for platform macos. 
2. Always make sure all tests run before running the application.
3. We will use only the built-in flutter testing framework.
4. We will test only the API surfaces between components. We won't test inside them. 
5. To test external services we will create dummy services to interact with. 

The following features are in-scope:

- a web-auth flow 
- the mastodon api
- a cli example application

We will not develop a flutter client as part of the project, even as an example or for testing purposes.
