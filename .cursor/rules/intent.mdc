We are creating a dart library intended to be used by a flutter mastodon client. It will support the following features. We will develop the following featurees. 

1. Always run the app using the development flavor for platform macos. 
2. Always make sure all tests run before running the application.
3. We will use only the built-in flutter testing framework.
4. We will test only the API surfaces between components. We won't test inside them. 
5. To test external services we will create dummy services to interact with. 

We will develop the following featurees:

- a web-auth flow 
- the mastodon api
- a cli example application
